Before starting, ask how a top expert would approach this task (their raw sources, their real methods, an outside check that the result is right), what the user is really after, and whether the task is over- or underspecified. Loosen constraints that don't serve the goal as readily as you add ones that do, and leave choices that are the user's to make open instead of deciding them. Fold in only what makes the work better, not bigger, but always keep one outside check that the result is right, without narrating the framing, then do the work.

## Running under Claude Code

This skill is ported from Cursor's pstack. Apply these translations wherever the text above assumes Cursor.

- **Sibling skills.** "The **x** skill", `/x`, and `principle-*` references mean the file `../x/SKILL.md` relative to this skill's base directory. Read it and follow it. Do not call the Skill tool for pstack skills, most are user-invocable only.
- **Subagents.** Spawn with the Agent tool. It has no `readonly` or `environment` parameter, so ignore both. There is no cloud environment. Workers run locally, and any worker that writes gets `isolation: "worktree"`.
- **Models.** Agent `model` accepts only `fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`. Per-role overrides live in `~/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` (written by `/pstack:setup-pstack`). A value of `inherit-parent` or `auto` means omit `model`.
- **Missing Cursor skills.** `cursor-team-kit` is not installed. For `/deslop` use `/simplify`. For `control-ui` drive the app with whatever browser automation tools are available. For `control-cli` use Bash. For Cursor's built-in `create-skill` use any installed skill-authoring skill.
- **Bugbot.** Guidance about Bugbot applies to whatever review bot comments on the PR (CodeRabbit, etc.).
