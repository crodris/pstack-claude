# No comments

Spawn Comment Sicko. Act on accepted findings.

Defer to Comment Sicko's fresh perspective.

## Scope

Use the caller's files or diff. Otherwise use the current diff against the base branch, default `main`, including the working tree.

## Steps

1. Spawn `Agent` with `subagent_type: "comment-sicko"`. Pass the scope. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill. Do not restate its rules.
2. Inspect its report and diff. Reject application-code edits, scope escapes, exception-protected deletions, misstated `MUST KILL` reasons, and flags that treat kept intentional code as guilty. Reshape flags on our-code surprises stay actionable. Do not restore those comments. A keep survives only with proof it is about something we cannot change. Audit missed scoped lint and TypeScript suppressions. Correctness or safety suppressions stay actionable `MUST KILL`s. Restore deletions only with exact exceptions and scoped proof. Before accepting thin `IMPORTANT` or `do not remove` kills or keeps, run `/how` or `/why` on their symbol. If a kill is ambiguous, do not restore. If a keep is refuted or still ambiguous, delete it. Revert and rerun one rejected report with the failure named. Reject a second, report it open, and fail `/no-comments`.
3. Fix trivial accepted flags directly by deleting a dead path, dropping a parameter, or using the real API. If any fix needs a shape, run `/architect` once for the accepted set and surrounding code. Stop at the sketch. Architect shapes. Step 4 implements.
4. Implement the smallest root-cause fix in scope. Remove every named workaround. If the root cause is out of scope, land the smallest in-scope fix and report the rest open. The **principle-fix-root-causes** and **principle-redesign-from-first-principles** skills guide intent only. Neither authorizes widening the fence nor fixing instances outside it. Never bolt on symptom guards.
5. Constraint comments say `do not remove`, `do not change wording`, or `talk to X before changing`. Leave keeps about things we cannot change. Offer the cheapest in-scope type, runtime, test, or CI lint. Wait for interactive approval. Unattended and eval require caller pre-approval. If approved, encode then delete. Otherwise delete, report the constraint open, and sketch out-of-scope work.
6. Report the deletion count, restored comments, reruns, architect sketch, fixes, encoding offers, encodings, unenforced constraints, and other open work.

## Running under Claude Code

This skill is ported from Cursor's pstack. Apply these translations wherever the text above assumes Cursor.

- **Sibling skills.** "The **x** skill", `/x`, and `principle-*` references mean the file `../x/SKILL.md` relative to this skill's base directory. Read it and follow it. Do not call the Skill tool for pstack skills, most are user-invocable only.
- **Subagents.** Spawn with the Agent tool. It has no `readonly` or `environment` parameter, so ignore both. There is no cloud environment. Workers run locally, and any worker that writes gets `isolation: "worktree"`.
- **Models.** Agent `model` accepts only `fable`, `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`. Per-role overrides live in `$HOME/.claude/rules/pstack-models.md` (written by `/pstack:setup-pstack`). A value of `inherit-parent` or `auto` means omit `model`.
- **Missing Cursor skills.** `cursor-team-kit` is not installed. For `/deslop` use `/simplify`. For `control-ui` drive the app with whatever browser automation tools are available. For `control-cli` use Bash. For Cursor's built-in `create-skill` use any installed skill-authoring skill.
- **Bugbot.** Guidance about Bugbot applies to whatever review bot comments on the PR (CodeRabbit, etc.).
